# Class Notes
## GitHub
It is important to commit small, testable commits very frequently. This allows you to debug your code more efficiently.
## Markup
You can link to other files in your repository. For example, [here is my README](README.md)
## HTML
The nav tag identifies a section of your HTML as the main area of navigation on a page.
